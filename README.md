# Student Grade Management System

## Overview

This Java project implements a Student Grade Management System, a console-based application designed to manage student information and their academic grades. It showcases fundamental to intermediate Java concepts such as classes, objects, loops, conditional statements, methods, and basic data structures (ArrayList). The system provides a clear, logical structure for organizing and processing student data, demonstrating how to build functional Java applications.
